what is this service?

Sometimes we need to send a file from one computer to another, or download it,Build the FTP service complex or not allowed, but file transfer is a tiny thing, so I use Python to write the file transfer service, the code is very simple, applicable to the LAN, help you to facilitate the realization of file transfer.



how to user this service ?

server:
-------------------------
python fileServer.py

client:
--------------------------
python fileDownload.py your_file_name
note: your_file_name is a file from server,make sure file_path existed in server


python fileUpload.py  your_file_name
note:your_file_name is a file at your local computer.


so ,this is simple.
